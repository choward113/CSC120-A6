Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
Using a building superclass made it much easier to create the constructors of all the subclasses. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
The hashtables were new to me, and figuring out how to print out the contents of one was difficult. For someone doing the assignment in the future, I'd suggest looking through the documentation for any methods that may already exist.
